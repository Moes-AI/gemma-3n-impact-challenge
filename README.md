# Tree of Trust: Secure, On-Device AI with Gemma 3N

**Team Member:** [Your Name]

## Summary

Tree of Trust is a mobile application that creates a safe, private space for personal reflection and AI-powered conversation by running Google's Gemma 3N model directly on the user's device. In an era where online data is perpetually at risk, our solution ensures that a user's thoughts and queries are protected, with roots firmly planted in on-device processing. By eliminating the connection to a central server, we eliminate the primary vector for data breaches, fostering an environment where users can genuinely trust their digital tools.

## The Problem: A Crisis of Trust

Online, privacy is an illusion. Every major tech company, from social media giants to service providers, has suffered massive data breaches, exposing billions of user records. Users are justifiably wary of sharing sensitive information with cloud-based AI systems that collect and store their data. This fear creates a significant barrier to the adoption of AI for personal, meaningful tasks like mental health support, journaling, or creative brainstorming.

## Our Solution: Tree of Trust

Tree of Trust is a React Native mobile application that provides a sanctuary for private thoughts. The core features are:

* **100% On-Device & Offline:** All conversations are processed locally by Gemma. No internet connection is needed, and no data ever leaves the device.
* **Simple, Secure Interface:** A clean and intuitive chat interface designed to feel like a private, digital journal.
* **User-Controlled Data:** Users have full and explicit control over their conversation history.


## How We Used Gemma 3N

Gemma 3N is the heart of Tree of Trust. Its remarkable ability to run efficiently on-device is the core technology that makes this project possible. We specifically leveraged:

* **Local Inference:** We built a system within the React Native app to serve the Gemma 3N model locally, ensuring all AI processing happens completely offline.
* **Instruction-Tuned Capabilities:** We utilized the instruction-tuned variant of Gemma to create a responsive and helpful conversational agent without requiring any cloud-based API calls.
* **Efficiency and Performance:** Gemma's ideal balance of a small footprint and powerful performance was the critical factor that made a high-quality, on-device AI experience on a mobile device feasible.
